Cloud data is associated with your account and protected by row-level security policies.

Authentication tokens are stored securely on your device using platform-native secure storage (iOS Keychain / Android Keystore).

## Age Requirements & Children's Privacy

BucketBook is designed for parents, coaches, and athletes to track basketball statistics.

**App Users:** The person creating an account and using the app should be 13 years or older. Children under 13 may use the app with parental supervision and consent.   

**Player Profiles:** Users may create player profiles to track statistics for themselves or others (such as a parent tracking their child's games, or a coach tracking team members). Player profiles contain only basketball-related information (name, jersey number, optional photo, and game statistics) entered by the app user.

We do not knowingly collect personal information directly from children under 13. If a parent or guardian creates player profiles for their children, the parent is responsible for that data and may delete it at any time through the app.

If you believe we have inadvertently collected information from a child under 13 without proper consent, please contact us at support@bucket-book.com and we will promptly delete it

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the app and updating the "Last Updated" date.
